# Advent of Code

## Summary

For-fun repository filled with Eli's attempts at solving [Advent of Code](www.adventofcode.com) problems.

To approach each problem, I try to use a different language, though not necessarily the best language suited to the task at hand. This is more to practice with multiple languages.

Each solution file contains two main parts:

- File reading and parsing
- The solution to the problem at hand
